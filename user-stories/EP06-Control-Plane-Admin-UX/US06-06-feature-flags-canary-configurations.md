# User Story US06-06 — Feature flags and canary configurations

## Description
As a Platform Engineer, I want feature flags and canary controls so that new behaviors can be rolled out gradually.

## Components
- Backend: Feature flag and canary configuration model.
- Frontend: UI for toggling flags and assigning canaries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Feature flags can be defined and targeted to subsets of tenants or partitions.
- Canary configurations allow routing subsets of traffic to new versions.
- Flag and canary changes are logged and auditable.
