# User Story US06-07 — Schema registry admin UI

## Description
As a Platform Engineer, I want an admin UI for the schema registry so that I can inspect and manage schemas without calling APIs directly.

## Components
- Frontend: UI components for listing and viewing schemas and versions.
- Backend: Supporting APIs in the schema registry service.

## Acceptance Criteria
- UI lists all schemas with their versions and status.
- A selected schema can be viewed with formatted content and metadata.
- Actions such as deprecating a schema version are available with proper permissions.
