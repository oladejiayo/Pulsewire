# User Story US05-07 — Sample UI client for trades and book views

## Description
As a Product Stakeholder, I want a simple UI that visualizes trades and order book depth so that I can demonstrate PulseWire capabilities.

## Components
- Frontend: Web UI built with a modern framework (for example, React) consuming the WebSocket gateway.
- Backend: Static hosting and configuration for the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- UI can subscribe to at least one instrument and display live trades and book depth.
- UI shows connection status, latency indicators, and basic error messages.
- UI is suitable for demos and can be extended by other teams.
