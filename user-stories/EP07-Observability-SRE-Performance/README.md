# Epic EP07 — Observability / SRE / Performance Engineering

Scope: FR7, observability sections, SRE runbooks, and testing strategy for performance.

Goal: Provide metrics, logs, tracing, dashboards, alerts, and runbooks so that SREs can detect, diagnose, and resolve latency and reliability issues quickly.

User stories:

- US07-01 — Metrics instrumentation across stages
- US07-02 — Dashboards for latency, lag, and drops
- US07-03 — JVM and GC observability
- US07-04 — Control plane tracing with OpenTelemetry
- US07-05 — Alert rules for key SLOs
- US07-06 — SRE runbooks for common incidents
- US07-07 — Performance and soak test harness
