# PulseWire User Stories

This folder contains epics and user stories derived from the PulseWire PRD.

- Epics are numbered `EP01`–`EP09` and map to the workstreams in the PRD.
- User stories under each epic are numbered `US<epic>-<story>` (for example, `US01-01`).
- Stories are intentionally small and implementation-focused so they can be delivered quickly.
